# Architecture
The architecture for this runbook is as follow, we have one small machine (bastion) that you will connect into. The compute nodes will be on a separate private network linked with RDMA RoCE v2 networking. The bastion will be accesible through SSH from anyone with the key (or VNC if you decide to enable it). Compute nodes will only be accessible through the bastion inside the network. This is made possible with 1 Virtual Cloud Network with 2 subnets, one public and one private.

## Baseline Infrastructure
Cluster Networks are supported in the following regions.  In each case, we recommend using the baseline reference architecture and then adjusting it, as required, to meet your specific requirements: 
* VCN
  *	Public Subnet, Security List, Route Table
  *	Private Subnet, Security List, Route Table
  *	Internet Gateway
  *	NAT Gateway
*	Compute Nodes
  *	Bastion Host in a Public Subnet
  *	HPC Compute Nodes in Private Subnet

![](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-shared/blob/master/images/arch.png "Architecture for Running StarCCM+ in OCI")

The above baseline infrastructure provides the following specifications:
-	Networking
    -	1 x 100 Gbps RDMA over converged ethernet (ROCE) v2
    -	Latency as low as 1.5 µs
-	HPC Compute Nodes (BM.HPC2.36)
    -	6.4 TB Local NVME SSD storage per node
    -	36 cores per node
    -	384 GB memory per node

## Optional Infrastructure
### Storage
On top of the NVME SSD storage that comes with the HPC shape, you can also attach block volumes at 32k IOPS per volume, backed by Oracle’s highest performance SLA.  If you are using our solutions to launch the infrastructure, an nfs-share is installed by default on the NVME SSD storage in /mnt.  You can also install your own parallel file system on top of either the NVME SSD storage or block storage, depending on your performance requirements.
### Visualizer Node
You can create a visualizer node, such as a GPU VM or BM machine, depending on your requirements. This visualizer node can be your bastion host or else it can be separate.  Depending on the security requirements for the workload, the visualizer node can be placed in the private or public subnet.


# Launch Cluster Network Steps 
There are many ways to launch an HPC Cluster Network, this solutions guide will cover two different methods:
*	Via Marketplace
*	Manually
Depending on your OS, you will want to go with a specific method. If the HPC Cluster Network marketplace image or our OCI HPC CN Terraform scripts are used, this is for Oracle Linux 7 only. If you want to use CentOS, Ubuntu or another OS, manual configuration is required.

## Creation of Cluster Network through Marketplace
Marketplace holds applications and images that can be deployed with our infrastructure.  For customers that want to use Oracle Linux, an HPC Cluster Network image is available and can be launched from directly within marketplace.
1.	Within marketplace, select *Get App* at the top right.
2.	Select the OCI Region then click *Sign In*.
3.	Verify the version of the HPC Cluster image and then select the *Compartment* where the cluster will be launched. Accept the terms and conditions, then *Launch Stack*.
4.	Fill out the remaing details of the stack:
    1.	Select the desired *AD* for the compute shapes and the bastion.
    2.	Copy-paste your public *ssh key*
    3.	Type in the number of *Compute instances* for the cluster
5.	Click *Create*.
6.	Navigate to *Terraform Actions* then click *Apply*. This will launch the CN provisioning.
7.	Wait until the job shows ‘Succeeded’ then navigate to *Outputs* to obtain the bastion and compute node private IP’s. 


## Creation of Cluster Network through Manual Configuration
Marketplace holds applications and images that can be deployed with our infrastructure.  For customers that want to use Oracle Linux, you can manually create a cluster network as follows:
1.	Select the OCI Region on the top right.
2.	In the main menu, select Networking and Virtual Cloud Network
3.	Click on Start VCN Wizard, and select VCN with Internet Connectivity
4.	Choose and name, the right compartment, and use 172.16.0.0/16 as VCN CIDR, 172.16.0.0/24 for Public Subnet and 172.16.1.0/24 for Private Subnet
5.	In the main menu, select Compute, Instances, then Create Instance
6.	Change the Image and select the Oracle Image tab, select Oracle Linux 7 - HPC Cluster Networking Image
7.	Select the Availability Domain in which you can spin up a BM.HPC2.36 instance
8.	Change the shape to BM.HPC2.36 under Bare Metal and Specialty
9.	Select the VCN and the public subnet you created. 
10.	Add a public key to connect to the instance. This key will be used on all compute instances. 
11.	Once the machine is up, click on the created instance. Under More Actions, select Create Instance Configuration. You can now terminate the instance under More Actions. 
12.	In the main menu, select Compute, then Cluster Networks
13.	Click Create Cluster Network and fill in all the options. Use the VCN, private subnet and instance configuration that you just created. Select the AD in which you can launch BM.HPC2.36 instances. 
14.	Launch the cluster network. 
15.	While it is loading, create another instance under Main Menu, Compute and Instances.
16.	Put it in the public subnet that was just created, using your public key and shape should be VM.Standard2.1 or similar. This will be the bastion that we will use to connect to the cluster. 
17.	SCP the key to the cluster on the bastion at /home/opc/.ssh/cluster_key and copy it also to /home/opc/.ssh/id_rsa
18.	Navigate to Compute then Instance Pools in the Console and collect all the IP addresses for the cluster network pool. 
19.	Install the Provisioning Tool on the bastion via the following command:
```
sudo rpm -Uvh https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/hpc/b/rpms/o/oci-hpc-provision-20190905-63.7.2.x86_64.rpm
```
20.	Gather the private IPs from the compute nodes. Either from the Instances on the console, or using 
```
for i in `nmap -sL Private_Subnet_CIDR | grep "Nmap scan report for" | grep ")" | awk '{print $6}'`;do echo ${i:1:-1} >> /tmp/ips; done
```
21.	Install the Provisioning Tool via the following command:
```
ips=`cat /tmp/ips`
/opt/oci-hpc/setup-tools/cluster-provision/hpc_provision_cluster_nodes.sh -p -i /home/opc/.ssh/id_rsa $ips
```

# Access your Cluster 
The public IP address of the bastion can be found on the lower left menu under Outputs. If you navigate to your instances in the main menu, you will also find your bastion instance as well as the public IP. 

The Private Key to access the machines can also be found there. Copy the text in a file on your machine, let's say/home/user/key:
```
chmod 600 /home/user/key 
ssh -i /home/user/key opc@ipaddress 
```

# Configure Visualization
HPC workloads often require visualization tools for scheduling, monitoring or analyzing the output of the simulations.  In these scenarios, it is often desired to create a GPU visualization node for optimal resolution and post processing. A GUI is not installed by default on OCI instances; however, one can be configured easily using VNC or X11 remote display protocol. The subsections below will walk through how to create a GPU visualization node in the public subnet using TurboVNC and OpenGL.

## Setting Up a VNC on your bastion
By default, the only access to the Oracle Linux machine is through SSH in a console mode. If you want to see the graphical interface, you will need to set up a VNC connection. The following script will work for the default user opc. The password for the vnc session is set as "HPC_oci1" but it can be edited in the next set of commands.
If you are not currently connected to the headnode via SSH, please do so as these commands need to be run on the headnode.
```
sudo yum -y groupinstall "Server with GUI"
sudo yum -y install tigervnc-server mesa-libGL
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
sudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/vncserver@.service /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@:1.service
sudo sed -i 's/<USER>/opc/g' /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@:1.service
sudo sed -ie '/^ExecStart=/a PIDFile=/home/opc/.vnc/%H%i.pid' /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@:1.service
sudo mkdir /home/opc/.vnc/
sudo chown opc:opc /home/opc/.vnc
echo "password" | vncpasswd -f > /home/opc/.vnc/passwd
chown opc:opc /home/opc/.vnc/passwd
chmod 600 /home/opc/.vnc/passwd
sudo systemctl start vncserver@:1.service
sudo systemctl enable vncserver@:1.service
```

## Add a GPU instance.
The below steps are taken Using OpenGL to Enhance GPU Use cases on OCI - refer to the blog for more details. 
1.	Within the Console, navigate to Compute then Instances.
2.	Create a Compute Instance for the Visualization Node:
a.	Select the desired AD
b.	Select the desired GPU shape (either VM or BM)
c.	Specify a GPU-compatible Oracle Linux image
The latest Oracle Linux Image will automatically be GPU enabled. 
d.	Select the Cluster Network VCN and Public Subnet
e.	Copy-paste your public ssh key
f.	Click Create.
3.	Wait for the instance to provision then log into the instance via:   
```
ssh opc@<public ip> -i <private key> 
```
4.	Install X Window System, a display manager (GNOME/GDM), and a desktop environment (MATE):
```
sudo yum groupinstall "X Window System"
sudo yum install gdm
sudo yum groupinstall "MATE Desktop"
```
5.	Install VNC server and VirtualGL. Note that VirtualGL is an open source toolkit that lets any Linux or Unix console run OpenGL applications with full hardware acceleration.
```
sudo yum install https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/virtualgl/2.6.3/VirtualGL-2.6.3.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/turbovnc/2.2.4/turbovnc-2.2.4.x86_64.rpm
```
6.	Configure the X server to enable GPU sharing for virtual sessions. Run the following commands:
```
sudo nvidia-xconfig --use-display-device=none --busid="PCI:4:0:0"
```
7.	Configure the X server to enable GPU sharing for virtual sessions. Run the following commands:
```
sudo vglserver_config -config -s -f -t
```
8.	To avoid being locked out when the screen saver launches, set the local user password to something you can use later:
```
sudo passwd opc
```
9.	Change your VNC password to something you can use for logging on:
```
vncpasswd
```
10.	Restart the X Server:
```systemctl restart gdm
kill $(pgrep Xvnc)
vncserver
```
11.	Enable and Start GDM:
```
systemctl enable gdm --now
```
12.	Launch the VNC server:
```
/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -wm mate-session
```
13.	If you want to access the VNC server directly without SSH forwarding, ensure that your security list allows connections on port 5901/tcp.
    1.	In the Console, navigate to Networking then Virtual Cloud Networks.
    2.	Select Subnets and then the public subnet.
    3.	In the default security list, add an Ingress Rule with the following details:
        1.	Stateless: No
        2.	Source Type: CIDR
        3.	Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
        4.	IP Protocol: TCP
        5.	Source Port Range: All
        6.	Destination Port Range: 5901

Note: The standard VNC port is 5900 plus a display number (for example, 5901 for :1, 5902 for :2)

14.	Allow access in local firewall settings, as follows:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=5901/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
15.	Open TurboVNC or TigerVNC client. Enter the IP address connection as <public ip>:1




# Accessing a VNC
We will connect through an SSH tunnel to the instance. On your machine, connect using ssh
PORT below will be the number that results from 5900 + N. N is the display number, if the output for N was 1, PORT is 5901, if the output was 9, PORT is 5909
public_ip is the public IP address of the headnode, which is running the VNC server.
If you used the previous instructions, port will be 5901
```
ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 opc@public_ip
```
You can now connect using any VNC viewer using localhost:N as VNC server and the password you set during the vnc installation.
You can chose a VNC client that you prefer or use this guide to install on your local machine:
*	[Windows - TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/wiki/Setup-TigerVNC-server-%28Windows%29) 
*	[MacOS/Windows - RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/)


# Installing STAR-CCM+
There are a couple of library that need to be added to the Oracle Linux image on all the compute nodes.
```
sudo yum -y install libSM libX11 libXext libXt
```
You can download the STAR-CCM+ installer from the Siemens PLM website or push it to your machine using scp. 
```
scp /path/own/machine/STAR-CCM_version.zip opc@1.1.1.1:/home/opc/
```
Another possibility is to upload the installer into object storage. 
1.	In the main menu of the console, select Object Storage. 
2.	Choose the correct region on the top right
3.	Select the correct compartment on the left-hand side
4.	Create a bucket if you do not have one already created
5.	In the bucket, select upload object and specify the path of the installer. 
6.	Select the 3 dots on the right-hand side of the installer object and select Create Pre-Authenticated Request
7.	If you lose the URL, you cannot get it back, but you can regenerate a new Pre-Authenticated Request

Download the installer form object storage with
```
wget PAR_URL
```
Untar or unzip the installer depending on your version
```
tar -xf installer.tgz
unzip installer.tgz
```
Launch the installer on a shared location. By default, an HPC cluster has a NFS-share mounted on all the compute nodes. 
```
mkdir /mnt/nfs-share/install
/path/installscript.sh -i silent -DINSTALLDIR=/mnt/nfs-share/install/
```

# Running STAR-CCM+
Running Star-CCM+ is pretty straightforward: You can either start the GUI if you have a VNC session started with
```
/mnt/share/install/version/STAR-CCM+version/star/bin/starccm+
```
To specify the host you need to run on, you need to create a machinefile. You can generate it as follow, or manually. Format is hostname:corenumber.
```
sed 's/$/:36/' /etc/opt/oci-hpc/hostfile > machinefile
```
To run on multiple nodes, place the model.sim on the nfs-share drive (Ex:/mnt/nfs-share/work/) and replace the CORENUMBER and PODKEY.
```
/mnt/nfs-share/install/15.02.009/STAR-CCM+15.02.009/star/bin/starccm+ -batch -power\\ 
-licpath 1999@flex.cd-adapco.com -podkey PODKEY -np CORENUMBER 
-machinefile machinefile /mnt/nfs-share/work/model.sim
```
## MPI implementations and RDMA
Performances can really differ depending on the MPI that you are using. 3 are supported by Star-CCM+ out of the box.
 *	IBM Platform MPI: Default or flag platform
 *	Open MPI: Flag intel
 *	Intel MPI: Flag openmpi3
To specify options, you can use the flag -mppflags
When using OCI RDMA on a Cluster Network, you will need to specify these options:

### OpenMPI
For RDMA:
```
-mca btl self -x UCX_TLS=rc,self,sm -x HCOLL_ENABLE_MCAST_ALL=0 -mca coll_hcoll_enable 0 -x UCX_IB_TRAFFIC_CLASS=105 -x UCX_IB_GID_INDEX=3 
```
Additionaly, instead of disabling hyper-threading, you can also force the MPI to pin it on the first 36 cores:
```
--cpu-set 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35
```
### IntelMPI
For RDMA:
```
-mppflags "-iface enp94s0f0 -genv I_MPI_FABRICS=shm:dapl -genv DAT_OVERRIDE=/etc/dat.conf -genv I_MPI_DAT_LIBRARY=/usr/lib64/libdat2.so -genv I_MPI_DAPL_PROVIDER=ofa-v2-cma-roe-enp94s0f0 -genv I_MPI_FALLBACK=0"
Additionaly, instead of disabling hyper-threading, you can also force the MPI to pin it on the first 36 cores:
-genv I_MPI_PIN_PROCESSOR_LIST=0-33 -genv I_MPI_PROCESSOR_EXCLUDE_LIST=36-71
```

### PlatformMPI
For RDMA:
```
-mppflags "-intra=shm -e MPI_HASIC_UDAPL=ofa-v2-cma-roe-enp94s0f0 -UDAPL"
```
For better performances:
```
-prot -aff:automatic:bandwidth
```
To pin on the first 36 threads:
```
-cpu_bind=MAP_CPU:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 ,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35
```

# Benchmark Example
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-StarCCM/blob/master/Images/lemans.png" height="300">
</p>
Performances of STAR-CCM+ are often measured using the LeMans benchmark with 17 and 105 Millions cells. The next graphs are showing how using more nodes impact the runtime, with a scaling really close to 100%. RDMA network, which has not been discussed in this runbook, only start to differentiate versus regular TCP runs if the Cells / Core ratio starts to go down.
